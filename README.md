# DeskTV
A TVOS-alternative running natively under many OSes, written entirely in JavaScript

# Why did I made this?
I made this as an alternative to FireTV, AndroidTV, AppleTV, GoogleTV etc. It should be open source and should run on all devices, so I decided to code it in JavaScript with ElectronJS. It will run on Windows, Mac and many Linux ditributions, and could be easily changed per your needs.

# What features does it have?
Currently, there are following features planned and implemented:
| Feature               | Status |
