# DeskTV
A TVOS-alternative running natively under many OSes, written entirely in JavaScript

## Why did I made this?
I made this as an alternative to FireTV, AndroidTV, AppleTV, GoogleTV etc. It should be open source and should run on all devices, so I decided to code it in JavaScript with ElectronJS. It will run on Windows, Mac and many Linux ditributions, and could be easily changed per your needs.

## What features does it have?
Currently, there are following features planned and implemented:
| Feature               | Status |
|-----------------------|--------|
| Controller support    | ðŸš§     |
| Remote App support    | ðŸš§     |
| Full keyboard support | :x:    |
| App store             | :x:    |
| Home UI               | ðŸš§     |

## Which apps are there, and which apps are planned?
Sadly, there currently aren't any apps. As it would be possible to run any websites directly in the program, they have to be recoded to support our input system. If you want to port a website, feel free to do so! You can find tutorials on how to port websites in the wiki.

## How can I make a own app?
If you are the owner of a website and want to port it for DeskTV, you will also find a tutorial in the wiki.

# How can I help support this project?
